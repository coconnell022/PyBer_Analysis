# PyBer_Analysis
Performing an analysis of ride-sharing data using Jupyter Notebook and Matplotlib

## Overview of the analysis:
The purpose of this project was to perform an exploratory analysis on ride-sharing data using visualizations to provide key insights that will inform discussions within PyBer. The original analysis was performed on various topics, like types of cities and their rider, driver, and fare data. After the initial analysis was performed, an additional request was made to create a summary of the ride-sharing data by city type that focuses on the weekly fares for each. 

       ### Resources
             - Data Sources: city_data.csv, ride_data.csv
             - Software: Python 3.7.6, Jupyter-Notebook 6.0.3, Anaconda 4.8.3, Pandas, Matplotlib

## Results: 
After performing an analysis on the full data set, a summary DataFrame was created to show the ride-sharing data by city type. The summary DataFrame is shown below.

It can be concluded from this set of data that urban cities have the highest number of rides and drivers, with a total fare of close to **$40,000**. On the other hand, compared to urban and suburban cities, rural cities have about *4 times lower number of rides*. As a result of this, the total fare is significantly less than the other city types. One main reason this is occurring is that an urban city can often have a much larger population than a rural, resulting in the likelihood of residents using ride-sharing services to increase. 

Another conclusion that can be drawn from the results, is the differences in average fare per ride and driver. Even though urban cities have the highest number of rides and drivers, their average fares are lower because of the high volume of rides occurring in these cities. **As the number of rides increase, the average fare on those rides will decrease.**

The line chart below shows the total fare by city type through the first 4 months of 2019. This graph is a snapshot of the data for this specific timeframe that supports the overall results above.

## Summary:

As the data shows, there are several disparities for ride-sharing services within specific city types. One disparity is that rural areas are using ride-sharing services significantly less than urban and suburban. My recommendation to help alleviate this issue is to hire more drivers that have an understanding of their rural city to focus on increasing demand in areas where it is lacking. There is great potential for ride-sharing services to be successful in rural cities since public transportation is often lacking. 

Another disparity is the significantly lower average fare per driver within urban cities. In order to increase the fare for these drivers, the company can encourage urban drivers to relocate and aim to offer their services within rural and suburban cities instead. As drivers leave urban cities, the average fare per driver would increase. 

It would also be beneficial for the company to focus their efforts of marketing and hiring in areas where rides and drivers are lacking. For example, as shown in the summary table, in rural and suburban areas, the number of total rides is greater than the number of total drivers, whereas it is the opposite for urban cities. It is important within urban cities to market the ride-sharing service so that the total number of rides increase and equal opportunity is provided to all drivers to make an adequate income.
